### Amazon SQS ESB Connector

The Amazon SQS connector allows you to access the exposed API through the WSO2 ESB. Amazon SQS offers reliable and scalable hosted queues for storing messages as they travel between computers. By using Amazon SQS, you can move data between distributed components of your applications that perform different tasks without losing messages or requiring each component to be always available. The connector uses the Amazon SQS API reference.
